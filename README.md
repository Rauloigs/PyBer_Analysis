# PyBer_Analysis

## 1. Overview of the analysis

After been done with the first data V Isualize needed which was the following...

1.  Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
- The total number of rides for each city type.
- The average fares for each city type.
- The total number of drivers for each city type.

*All of the data above was intended to plot the following **bubble chart**:

2. Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
- The number of rides for each city type.

3. Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
- The percent of total fares.

... V. Isualize gave the task to create a **Summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type** & a **Multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type**. So, in the next point we will review the Results of:

1. Ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
2. A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

## 2. Results

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
